## Where's the code? ##

We're very excited about this being an open source project, getting feedback from the community, and helping to make this plugin better together! 
We're hoping to get the code up as soon as we can, and have just a few loose ends to tie up to make it accessible and useful for everyone.
Sorry for the inconvenience! In the meantime, please feel free to use this repo to share your experience using the plugin and to file bugs, issues, and feature requests while we get the code up and public. Thanks for your patience!
